## Introduction: A Doorway to Open-Closed Enchantment ✨

In the grand tapestry of software design, there exists a constellation of guiding stars known as the SOLID principles. Among them, the Open-Closed Principle (OC) glimmers with a quiet, mystical elegance. It whispers a promise to every developer who dares to listen: _"Your code shall be open for extension, yet closed for modification."_ A paradox, perhaps, but one that holds the power to transform how we conjure code into existence.

Imagine your codebase as a magical castle. 🏰 The Open-Closed Principle ensures you can add new towers and wings without disrupting the existing walls. It safeguards the integrity of your creation, welcoming change while banishing the chaos of unintended consequences.

>_"The Open-Closed Principle is what separates fragile systems that break with every change from robust systems that adapt and thrive over time."_ — [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)

In the world of TypeScript, this principle is not just a theoretical ideal but a tangible, practical guide—a sorcerer’s tool that allows you to craft spells (or rather, code) that evolve gracefully over time. It spares you the toil of endless bug-fixing rituals and shields you from the chaos of unintended consequences. As we venture into this principle’s depths, you’ll discover it’s more than a rule—it’s a philosophy that transforms how you think about design.

Prepare your wands—or rather, your IDEs—for a quest into the Open-Closed Principle, unlocking the secrets of scalable design.

## The Heart of the Open-Closed Principle 🌟

At its core, the Open-Closed Principle (OC) offers developers a timeless paradox: systems should be open for extension but closed for modification. But what does this truly mean, and how can it guide us in crafting magical, maintainable software?

Imagine a delicate clockwork machine, its gears and levers working in perfect harmony. Each piece has its place, and the whole contraption functions beautifully. 🕰️ Now, picture adding a new feature—a second hand to the clock. Without the Open-Closed Principle, you might need to rip apart the entire mechanism, risking chaos in your design. With OC, however, you add this second hand gracefully, enhancing functionality without disrupting the existing system.

### What Does Open-Closed Mean?
The Open-Closed Principle asks us to strike a balance. Our designs should:
- **Be open for extension**: Allowing new behaviors to be added when requirements change.
- **Be closed for modification**: Avoiding changes to existing, tested, and reliable code.

In TypeScript, this often means using abstraction to create flexible structures that adapt to new needs. Instead of directly modifying an existing function or class, you enhance functionality by adding new components, often leveraging interfaces, inheritance, or composition.

### The Role of TypeScript’s Magic
TypeScript equips us with tools to wield the Open-Closed Principle effectively:
- **Interfaces** act like blueprints, enabling us to define contracts for behavior.
- **Abstract classes** provide a foundation that others can build upon without altering the core.
- **Generics** allow reusable and flexible structures.

Through these tools, OC transforms into a practical approach to design, guiding us toward stability and adaptability.

In the next section, we’ll step into the shoes of an apprentice and craft a simple TypeScript example. With this, we’ll uncover what happens when OC is ignored—and how applying its magic can illuminate a better path.

## The Apprentice’s First Spell: A Simple Example 🪄

Let us begin with a tale of two realities: one where the Open-Closed Principle is but a distant dream, and another where its magic reshapes how we design our code. Our journey starts with a simple scenario.

The Problem: A Spellbook Without Structure
Imagine we’re crafting a program for a magical bookstore. This program calculates discounts for different customer types: wizards, alchemists, and apprentices. Here’s our initial implementation:

```typescript
class DiscountCalculator {
  calculate(customerType: string, amount: number): number {
    if (customerType === "wizard") {
      return amount * 0.9; // 10% off for wizards
    } else if (customerType === "alchemist") {
      return amount * 0.85; // 15% off for alchemists
    } else if (customerType === "apprentice") {
      return amount * 0.95; // 5% off for apprentices
    } else {
      return amount; // No discount
    }
  }
}
```

At first glance, this spell appears functional. But what happens when new customer types emerge? Say we introduce "sorcerers" or "artificers." Modifying the `DiscountCalculator` class each time disrupts the harmony of the existing code. It violates OC, leading to an unwieldy web of conditions.

```typescript
// Step 1: Define a common interface for discounts
interface DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number;
}

// Step 2: Implement specific discount strategies
class WizardDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.9;
  }
}

class AlchemistDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.85;
  }
}

class ApprenticeDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.95;
  }
}

// Step 3: Modify the calculator to use strategies
class DiscountCalculator {
  private strategy: DiscountStrategy;

  constructor(strategy: DiscountStrategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return this.strategy.calculate(amount);
  }
}
```

Now, when a new customer type emerges, we add a new strategy (e.g., `SorcererDiscount`) without altering the `DiscountCalculator` class. This keeps the original codebase intact, adhering to OC’s magical promise.

### Testing the Spell
Here’s how we might use the new structure:

```typescript
const wizardCalculator = new DiscountCalculator(new WizardDiscount());
console.log(wizardCalculator.calculate(100)); // Output: 90

const alchemistCalculator = new DiscountCalculator(new AlchemistDiscount());
console.log(alchemistCalculator.calculate(100)); // Output: 85
```

The system is now extendable. Adding a new discount type only requires creating a new strategy class—leaving the rest of the code untouched.

## Building the Enchanted Fortress: Scaling with Elegance 🏰

With the foundation of the Open-Closed Principle laid, let us now fortify our enchanted bookstore. We’ll evolve our system, accommodating more complex requirements while maintaining its magical balance.

### The Challenge: Expanding the Realm
Our bookstore has grown. We now offer seasonal promotions, loyalty bonuses, and bundle discounts. Each of these requires its own calculation logic. Without a structured approach, this complexity could turn our elegant spellbook into a chaotic tome of conditions. Let’s see how OC helps us keep the magic alive.

### Enhancing the Spell: Composition Over Inheritance
Rather than relying solely on inheritance, we’ll embrace composition, which allows us to combine multiple behaviors dynamically. This design ensures our system is flexible enough to scale with new requirements.

Here’s how we can extend the `DiscountCalculator` to handle multiple discounts dynamically:

```typescript
// Step 1: Create a composite strategy
class CompositeDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  private strategies: DiscountStrategy[];

  constructor(...strategies: DiscountStrategy[]) {
    this.strategies = strategies;
  }

  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return this.strategies.reduce((currentAmount, strategy) => strategy.calculate(currentAmount), amount);
  }
}

// Step 2: Add new discount strategies
class SeasonalDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.8; // 20% off for seasonal sales
  }
}

class LoyaltyDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.95; // 5% off for loyal customers
  }
}

// Step 3: Enhance the calculator to use composite strategies
const seasonalLoyaltyCalculator = new DiscountCalculator(
  new CompositeDiscount(new SeasonalDiscount(), new LoyaltyDiscount())
);

console.log(seasonalLoyaltyCalculator.calculate(100)); // Output: 76 (20% off, then 5% off)
```

With this approach, new discount types—such as flash sales or limited-time promotions—can be added seamlessly by creating new strategies and combining them. The `CompositeDiscount` acts as a flexible spell that combines these effects dynamically, all without modifying the core `DiscountCalculator` class.
